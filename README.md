# Research and Optimization of 'Lost-in-the-Middle' in Long-Context Processing of Large Language Models üê£

This repository contains the materials and code for my graduation thesis, titled *"Research and Optimization of 'Lost-in-the-Middle' in Long-Context Processing of Large Language Models"*.

## Setup üöÄ
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivy3h/LITM_Thesis.git
cd LITM_Thesis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Optimization Methods Based on Model Training üî•





## Optimization Methods Based on Explicit Attention Adjustment üéØ


### U-shaped Attention Visualization

To visualize the U-shaped attention distribution on the Natural Questions-based multi-document question answering task, execute the following commands:

```bash
python attention_visual.py
```

### FocusICL

To run the FocusICL evaluation on GSM8K and MMLU datasets, execute the following commands:

```bash
python attention_eval.py \
    --model_name Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct \
    --dataset gsm8k \
    --num_eval_samples 500 \
    --k_values 20 40 60 80 \
    --p_values 0.1 0.2 0.3 \
    --seed 42
```
Replace the --dataset argument with mmlu to run on the MMLU dataset.
